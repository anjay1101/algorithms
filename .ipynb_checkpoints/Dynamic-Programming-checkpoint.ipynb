    "Dynamic-Programming algorithms work by building an optimal solution for a problem from optimal solutions for subproblems. The two main tasks involved when coming up with a DP solution are to: \n",
    "1. Define the sub-problems \n",
    "2. Define the recursive nature or how the optimal solutions to sub-problems combine into solutions for bigger problems. \n",

    "The key efficiency step is defining and storing sub-problems in such a way that their solutions get used multiple times in solving larger problems. "

The sub-problem, P(i), will be defined as the i$^{th}$ ith Fibonnaci number. As we build our solution, we will store the previously determined sub-problems in a set, so we don't have to calculate them again. The recursive step is defined by the solution to $P(i)$ being $P(i-1)+P(i-2)$."
